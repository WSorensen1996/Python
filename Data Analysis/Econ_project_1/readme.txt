Intro

(Full report not included)

The purpose of this project is to formulate an econometric model in which we estimate parameters by
various methods and test the hypothesis that a Cobb-Douglas production function yields constant returns.
In addition, we test if the conditions for the various methods hold after which we conclude the
most valid method. We test the hypothesis by Wald-test with the most valid method.
The given data is a panel data set with T = 12 and it contains two explanatory variables: log of
employment (lit) and log of adjusted capital stock (kit). The output variable is log of deflated sales. N,
the number of firms, is 441.
The econometric model is as following:
yit = βKkit + βLlit + vit
Where vit = ln(Ait. Ait consists of two error terms, ci which is time invariant and uit which is time
dependent.


We have formulated an econometric model where we estimated the parameters by the following methods:
Pooled OLS, fixed effects, first differences and random effects. For these methods to be valid the conditions
have to be met. Through various tests it can be concluded that the conditions for pooled OLS, fixed
effects and random effects doesn’t hold. Vice versa, we learned that the conditions for first differences to
be valid were met. Although, it has to be stated that there is no strict exogeneity but we have argued that
FD consists of more exogeneity than FE. Thus, it can be concluded that, with the given data, the firms
don’t have CRS but diminishing returns since we saw in figure 3(Found in full report) that ˆ βFD K = 0.0630 and ˆ βFD L = 0.5487.
